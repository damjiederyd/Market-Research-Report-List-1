<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Conduction Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BAHA</li><li>Bone Conduction Headphones</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone conduction devices market primarily includes Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA) and bone conduction headphones. BAHA assists individuals with hearing loss by transmitting sound vibrations directly to the inner ear through the skull, bypassing damaged outer or middle ear structures. In contrast, bone conduction headphones transmit audio through vibrations on the skull, enabling users to hear without covering their ears, making them popular for activities like sports and for individuals with hearing impairments. Both technologies utilize the principles of bone conduction for enhanced auditory experiences.</p></p>
