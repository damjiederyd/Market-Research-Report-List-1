<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Novolac Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Novolac resins are specialized phenolic compounds categorized primarily into thermoplastic and thermosetting types. Thermoplastic novolac resins can be reprocessed and reshaped upon heating, making them versatile for applications like coatings and adhesives. In contrast, thermosetting novolac resins undergo a chemical reaction during curing, resulting in a rigid, durable structure that cannot be remelted. This characteristic makes thermosetting novolac resins ideal for high-temperature applications such as electrical insulations and automotive components, benefiting from their stability and thermal resistance.</p></p>
